{"name":"The Big Student Project","tagline":"Rutgers Course Recommender System","body":"## Team\r\n* [Simiao Gao](http://simiaogao.com/) (leader)\r\n* [Joshua Devasagayaraj](http://joshdev.me/) \r\n* Prof. Manish Parashar (advisor)\r\n\r\n## Motivation, Scope and Impact\r\n\r\nEvery single semester at Rutgers, there are around 14,000 course offerings that are available for a student to choose from. So, before the beginning of every semester, every student is facing the same common problem: How would I choose around 5 course offerings from a pool so large? This problem is quite serious because it could impact the student’s performance, future career path and success. Some of the questions this student may also ask include:\r\n\r\nWhich class / set of classes best suits me?\r\nWhat are other students like me taking?\r\nWhich class / set of classes will make me more competitive in the current market?\r\nBased on the classes of my choice, what would my curriculum for every semester before I graduate looks like?\r\nWhat did other successful students of the same major take?\r\n\r\nTo solve these problems, we decided to create a research project that utilizes the past 15 years of student records and perform a k-nearest correlation search. For every single current student, we want to find the top 50 students (either current or alumni) that are closely correlated to him based on certain indicators (e.g. degree, major, course course, grades). Based on these 50 students, we want to come out with several good curriculums that help the student to forecast what his/her future would be, also, we want to find out the path that would be efficient and most effective for him/her to walk.\r\n\r\nThen we zoom out with nearly 50,000 students’ future curriculum choices in hand. The scheduling office can use these to better prepare the supply of courses in the upcoming semesters. This can minimize problems like students not getting into classes that they want because they are closed or having a conflict and students having to spend too much time commuting because their courses are scattered across different campuses.\r\n\r\n### Milestones\r\n\r\n| Date  | Deliverable |\r\n|:------------- |:------------- |\r\n| 2/7/2014  | 1.

Finding a pattern in the data to make good course recommendations is hard because\r\n     * hard to decide which parameter to use.\r\n     * hard to identify the weight of each parameter on the result of our recommendation.\r\n   2. Limited resources. \r\n     * Only 15 years of data. Older data are stored in cold format and are kept from us.\r\n     * Only 4-node hadoop cluster with a total of 8GB RAM, 8-CORE CPU, and 800GB HDD.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
